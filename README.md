# Arduino-Discord-Logs
This system enables efficient data transfer between an Arduino UNO board and a Discord server using JavaScript. It reads temperature data from the Arduino, processes it, and sends structured reports to a Discord channel via a webhook, facilitating real-time temperature monitoring and reporting.
